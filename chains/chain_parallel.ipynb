      "Cons:\n",
      "While the MacBook Pro is widely regarded as a high-performance laptop with numerous advantages, there are some potential drawbacks associated with its features. Here are the cons of the features listed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Display**:\n",
      "   - **Price**: The high-resolution Retina display can contribute to the overall cost of the laptop, making it less accessible for budget-conscious consumers.\n",
      "   - **Reflectivity**: The glossy finish of the display can lead to glare in bright environments, which may hinder visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Processor**:\n",
      "   - **Compatibility**: Some legacy software and applications may not be fully optimized for Apple Silicon, potentially leading to performance issues or the need for workarounds.\n",
